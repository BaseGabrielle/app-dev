## Favorite Movie/Series : Shadowhunters
*Details*
---
This series is a an adaptation of Cassandra Clare's book series **"The Mortal Instruments"**.
I have not read all the books that's why I don't know yet how much it was changed from the written stories to the ones
that I watched through screens. The story follows the main character named Clarissa, or Clary Fray into her
first endeavors in the world of Shadowhunters after she turned 18. This takes place in New York City, but they often
also change settings. She unraveled secrets of her pasts and helped defeating the enemies that they encounter.

- Isabelle Lightwood, aka. Izzie
- Magnus Bane, a warlock
- Alec Lightwood
- Luke
- Maia
- Maryse
